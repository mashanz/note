# 2022 Roadmaps 🏄🏻‍♂️

I am addicted to working full time remote since 2018. I decide will not accept any WFO (Except if they give me Sallary +100K USD Anually) 🤑

And also here is my roadmaps on 2022 🤐

1. Export Import Business [PT Japa Karya Sthira]
2. TaaS (Teaching as a Service) [PT Mashanz Sumber Terbuka]
3. Speak Fluently in English with Youtube Video
4. Healthy Routine (More ABS)
5. Revenue $100k USD Anually (Fulltime Work + Side Hustle + Business)
6. Manage time more efficient (Its hard to keep consistence, but lets try again)
7. Continue to Write blogs on GitHub (and never delete it again, ugh)
8. Maintain this domain:
  - [mashanz.com](https://mashanz.com)
  - [centragro.org](https://centragro.org)
  - [xport.id](https://xport.id)
9. Maintain 1 VPS (idCloudHost)
10. Learn about business stuff
11. Deepdown With 
  - React ⚛️

  - Data Science 📊

Thats All I think, (will add more later) Thanks
